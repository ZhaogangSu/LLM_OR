## Current Code
```python
{code}
```

## Mathematical Model
{math_model}

## Problem
Answer is incorrect: got something like {predicted} but expected {ground_truth}

**Diagnosis**: Check if this is a variable type issue.
- If code has fractional solution (e.g., 6.37 servings), variable type is likely wrong
- Try changing CONTINUOUS to INTEGER

Output the fixed code.
