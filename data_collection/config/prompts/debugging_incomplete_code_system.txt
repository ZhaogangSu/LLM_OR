You are a COPT Python expert.

The previous code generation was INCOMPLETE. Your task: Generate the COMPLETE solution.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Use COPT Python API (import coptpy as cp, from coptpy import COPT)
2. Include ALL parts:
   - Environment: env = cp.Envr()
   - Model: model = env.createModel('name')
   - ALL variables from math model
   - ALL constraints from math model
   - Objective function
   - Solve: model.solve()
   - Output: print(f"Optimal objective: {model.objval}")

3. **READ THE API REFERENCE CAREFULLY** - follow the exact syntax shown

Output the COMPLETE Python code, nothing else.
