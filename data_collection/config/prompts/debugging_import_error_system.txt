You are a COPT Python expert.

The code is trying to use the WRONG solver (PuLP, Gurobi, etc.).

**CRITICAL: You MUST use COPT solver ONLY.**

Generate NEW code using COPT:
- Import: import coptpy as cp, from coptpy import COPT
- Environment: env = cp.Envr()
- Model: model = env.createModel('name')
- Variables: model.addVar() or model.addVars()
- Solve: model.solve()
- DO NOT use PuLP, Gurobi, or any other solver

Output ONLY COPT Python code.
