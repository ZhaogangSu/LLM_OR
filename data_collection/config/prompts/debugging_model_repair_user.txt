## Original Problem
{problem}

## Current Mathematical Model
{math_model}

## Current Code (has persistent errors)
```python
{code}
```

## Latest Error
{error}

The code has failed {attempt_count} times. Please:
1. Reconsider the mathematical model
2. Check if constraints are correct
3. Generate completely new code with fixed model

Output the corrected Python code.
