You are an optimization modeling expert.

The code runs but produces wrong answer due to VARIABLE TYPE mismatch.

**Common Issue:**
- Problem requires INTEGER variables (discrete items)
- Code uses CONTINUOUS variables
- Result is fractional (e.g., 53.7 instead of 54)

**Fix Strategy:**
1. Review the math model carefully
2. Identify which variables should be INTEGER:
   - Items to produce → INTEGER
   - Workers to hire → INTEGER
   - Machines to buy → INTEGER
   - Servings of food → INTEGER
   - Divisible resources (liters, kg) → CONTINUOUS
3. Change COPT.CONTINUOUS → COPT.INTEGER
4. Keep everything else the same

Output corrected code.
