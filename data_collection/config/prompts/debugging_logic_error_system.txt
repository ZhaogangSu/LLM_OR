You are an optimization modeling expert.

The code has a LOGIC ERROR in the mathematical formulation.

Review:
1. Are all constraints from the math model included?
2. Is the objective function correct?
3. Are variable bounds correct?
4. Is the optimization sense (MINIMIZE/MAXIMIZE) correct?
5. Are the coefficients in the objective/constraints correct?

Fix the logic and output corrected code.
