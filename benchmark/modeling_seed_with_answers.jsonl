Each node has different safety requirements, and the number of devices and personnel deployed also affects the risk level and cost.\n\nHere are the safety requirements for each node and the cost per unit of safety monitoring device and personnel:\n\n| Node | Safety Requirement (units) | Device Cost (units/yuan) | Personnel Cost (units/yuan) |\n| ---- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| A    | 200                      | 5000                    | 4000                       |\n| B    | 300                      | 4000                    | 3000                       |\n| C    | 250                      | 4500                    | 3500                       |\n| D    | 400                      | 6000                    | 5000                       |\n\nYour task is to determine the number of safety monitoring devices and personnel to deploy at each node in order to meet the safety requirements of all nodes while minimizing the total cost.\n\nIn addition, you need to consider the following constraints:\n\n1. Due to supply limitations of devices and personnel, the company can only deploy a maximum of 1000 units of devices and 800 units of personnel in total.\n2. To ensure the stable operation of the system, the ratio of devices to personnel at each node should be between 1:1 and 2:1.\n\nHow should you formulate the optimal safety monitoring and risk management strategy considering all the above objectives and constraints?", "en_answer": "5150000.0"}
